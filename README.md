# gwt-ext-jre-emulation
Additional emulated classes for GWT

The main goals of this project are 
- to provide commonly used classes that are currently not available in the jre-emulation of GWT. Like LocalDate.
- to wrap some existing GWT classes that force users to learn different API. Like Pattern vs. RegEx.
